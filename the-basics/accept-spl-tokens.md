# Accept SPL tokens

As previously mentioned, while creating your Hydra wallet, you can set it to accept some SPL token. You can also do this later through the wallet details page through the icon next to "Accept SPL token".

A small form will be revealed where you can enable the "Accept SPL Tokens" checkbox, enter the public key of the SPL token mint, and click "Update" to accept SPL tokens.
