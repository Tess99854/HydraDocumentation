# Funding your wallet

The "Fund Wallet" button on the wallet details page opens up a modal where you can send SOL or SPL tokens to the wallet.

The Hydra wallet native account is the SOL receiving account of the wallet; you can fund the wallet by just sending SOL to this account or through the modal by entering the amount and clicking "Send".

If the wallet accepts SPL tokens and you have some amount of the SPL token that the wallet accepts, you can fund the wallet with SPL tokens by choosing "SPL" from the "Token" menu and entering the amount you want to transfer to the wallet.
