# Funding your wallet

The _Fund Wallet_ button on the wallet details page opens up a modal where you can send SOL or SPL tokens to the wallet.

The Hydra wallet's native account is the one to which you must send SOL in order to fund your wallet; there are two methods to achieve this:

* Manually via Solana CLI or any other external tools
* Through the hydra wallet application by filling out the Funding modal form and clicking _Send_

If the wallet accepts an SPL token that you have in your possession, you can fund the wallet with SPL tokens by choosing "SPL" from the "Token" menu and entering the amount you want to transfer to the wallet.
