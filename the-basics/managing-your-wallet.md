# Managing your wallet

## Listing you wallets&#x20;

On the "Manage" page, you can see all the Hydra wallets that you are the authority of or a member of. If you own an NFT which is a member of some Hydra wallet, you will also see it on this page.

Notice that only Hydra wallets created through the application are manageable here; if you have other wallets that have been created through the command line or by any other means, they will not be visible here.

## Checking wallet details

Click on a wallet to navigate to its corresponding wallet details page. At the top of the page, you can see the name of the wallet, the public key of its configuration account, and a couple of buttons through which you can [fund the wallet](funding-your-wallet.md) or [add members](adding-members.md) to it.

The "Other Wallets" button takes you back to the [wallet list page](managing-your-wallet.md#listing-you-wallets). The "Refresh" button refreshes some of the wallet details, like the available shares and the current balance.

You can see the authority of the wallet as well as a listing of the members of the wallet (added through the application). There are two ways in which you can distribute funds to the members of the wallet:

* Distribute to each member individually
* Distribute to all members at once

At the bottom of the members table you can see the total number of members.

The membership model of the wallet in addition to the current balance and which SPL token the wallet accepts, if any, are displayed at the very bottom of the page.

If the wallet does not currently accept SPL tokens, you can edit that through the icon to the right of "Accept SPL token".
