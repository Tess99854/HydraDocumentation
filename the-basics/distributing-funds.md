# Distributing funds

There are two ways in which you can distribute funds to the members of the wallet:

* Distribute to each member individually
* Distribute to all members at once

Click on _Distribute_ next to the member you want to distribute funds to or click on _Distribute All_ to distribute funds to all members and then accept the transaction through your wallet provider to proceed.

The amount received by members is determined by the number of shares they own; the relationship is simple: the fraction of funds received by a member is the fraction of their shares from the total shares.

As an example, a member who holds 50 shares in a wallet that has 100 shares will receive half of the wallet's funds.

It should be noted that the distribute buttons will be disabled if the total number of shares is less than the sum of the members' shares.
