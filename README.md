# Get Started

## What is Hydra Wallet

The Hydra wallet is a wallet of wallets, with the primary goal of managing a DAO organization's treasury, collecting royalties based on the member's share, and distributing assets to different members.

Simply put, a hydra wallet is a wallet that can be funded with SOL -Solana's native cryptocurrency- or SPL tokens and shared by an unlimited number of participants.

### Wallet memberships

Being a member of a Hydra Wallet grants you access to particular information about the wallet, like its balance, type, and members. You will also be able to receive funds based on your shares and distribute assets to other members.

The way things work varies slightly depending on the membership type; let's start by listing the types supported by the Hydra Wallet web application:

#### Wallet membership&#x20;

This is the most basic membership model. The wallet's members are Solana wallets that can be added by specifying their public keys and the number of shares they own.

#### NFT membership

For this membership type, the Hydra wallet members are NFT mint addresses. Similarly, you specify the number of shares for each member NFT. The greatest benefit of this model is that it effectively enables the simple transfer of rights to future distributions to any wallet owner that holds the given NFT.

One use case of this model is to distribute NFT sale royalties to the current holders of your NFTs.

### Accepting SPL tokens&#x20;

In addition to SOL, you can also distribute other digital assets to your members, such as SPL tokens, which are custom fungible tokens on the Solana blockchain.

Once your wallet is configured to [accept SPL](./#spl-tokens), you can begin funding and distributing the specified SPL token. In the parts that follow, we'll go over how to achieve this in more detail.

## Moving on

Now that we've familiarized ourselves with the fundamental concepts, we can experiment with the Hydra wallet application to get the hang of its various functionalities.
